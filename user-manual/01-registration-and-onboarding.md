## Onboarding Wizard

After your first login, you'll be guided through a 3-step onboarding wizard to get you started:

### Step 1: Connect to CQ AI Gateway

CQ AI Gateway provides access to top AI services (Claude, Gemini, Grok, and more) for powering your Spirits.

- **Automatic setup**: If you selected `Auto-create also CQ AI Gateway account`, your API key is created automatically during registration — you get **free starting credits** to begin immediately
- **Manual setup**: Enter your CQ AI Gateway API key if you have one
- **Skip**: You can skip this step and configure it later in Settings

### Step 2: Create Your First Spirit

A Spirit is your personal AI companion. Give it:
- **Name** — choose any name you like
- **Color** — pick a color to visually identify your Spirit

A smart default AI model is selected automatically, so you can start chatting right away. You can always change the model later in the Spirit Profile.

### Step 3: After Onboarding

#### Start Your Journey (Option A)

Click **Start** to open your first conversation with your new Spirit. From here, you can explore all of CitadelQuest's features together!

#### Explore Dashboard (Option B)

Click **Dashboard** to open your central hub for everything in CitadelQuest. See [Dashboard](02-dashboard.md) for details.
