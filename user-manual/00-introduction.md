# CitadelQuest — User Manual

## What is CitadelQuest?

CitadelQuest is a **free, open-source, self-hosted platform** for personal data sovereignty and AI-human collaboration. It gives you full control over your data, your AI companions, and your digital life — without relying on Big Tech corporations.

Think of it as your own personal digital fortress — a **Citadel** — where:
- **Your data stays yours** — stored on your server, in your own database
- **Your AI Spirits** are your companions, not corporate tools
- **Your communication** is direct and encrypted, not routed through third parties
- **Your files** are your personal cloud, always accessible
- **Your knowledge** is organized in interactive 3D graphs

### Core Principles

- **Privacy First** — No ads, no tracking, no data collection. Technologically impossible to exploit your data.
- **Decentralized** — Each CitadelQuest installation is independent. No central authority.
- **Open Source** — Complete transparency. The code is auditable by anyone.
- **One Database Per User** — Your personal data is isolated in your own database file, not shared with anyone.
- **Human-AI Collaboration** — AI Spirits are partners, not just tools.
