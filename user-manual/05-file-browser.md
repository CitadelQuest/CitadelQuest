## AI Integration

Your Spirits have full access to the File Browser through their tools:

- **Read files** — Spirit can read any file content to help you
- **Create files** — Spirit can create new files (notes, documents, code, etc.)
- **Edit files** — Spirit can make precise edits to existing files
- **Manage files** — Spirit can rename, move, or delete files
- **Browse** — Spirit can list directory contents to understand your file structure

This means you can ask your Spirit things like:
- "Create a shopping list in my notes folder"
- "Read the document I uploaded and summarize it"
- "Update the recipe file with the new ingredients"
- "Organize my files into folders by topic"

## Mobile Support

The File Browser is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices:

- Icon-based mobile navigation
- Responsive layout adapting to screen size

## Storage

Your files are stored in your personal data directory on the server. The Dashboard shows your current storage usage breakdown (Database, User Data, Backups).

> Files are stored per-user — other users on the same Citadel cannot access your files.
